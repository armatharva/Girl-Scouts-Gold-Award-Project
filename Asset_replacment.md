# Asset Replacement Instructions

## Replacing the Girl Scouts Logo

**Current Status:** The logo is currently using a placeholder image from Unsplash.

**To replace with your actual Girl Scouts logo:**

1. **Prepare your logo file:**
   - Recommended format: PNG with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 100x100 pixels or larger (square ratio works best)
   - Save it as `girl-scouts-logo.png`

2. **Add the logo to your project:**
   - If deploying to GitHub Pages: Put the logo in a `public/images/` folder
   - Update the src path in `/App.tsx` on line 22:
   ```jsx
   src="./images/girl-scouts-logo.png"
   ```

3. **Alternative hosting options:**
   - Upload to a cloud service (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) and use the direct image URL
   - Use a service like Imgur for image hosting
